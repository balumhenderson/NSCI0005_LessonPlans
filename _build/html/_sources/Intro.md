## Intro
Lesson plans for the mathematics for natural sciences A course (NSCI0005). Useful information and announcements will be shared here, as well as on the [Moodle Page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=26023#section-0).

Each week, some of the weekly questions will be answered here to make them easier to go through in the tutorials. Please attempt the questions before coming to the tutorial sessions.

## Course layout
Your mark for the NSCI0005 course will consist of a final written exam (50%), your stats coursework (30%) and some online maths quizzes (20%).

There will also be weekly question sheets released with the lecture notes, including one homework question. This question should be submitted to be marked each week so that you can get used to feedback from the tutors. Please have this submitted by 2 PM the Tuesday of the following week, so that it can be marked and back to you by the Friday tutorial sessions. The mark for these questions does **not** count towards your final grade.
