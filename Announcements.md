## Week 1 - 28/10/2022
Welcome to your NSCI0005 tutorials!

The [Moodle Page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=26023) for this course holds all of the information you should need, including questions sheets, deadline information, contact details and submission links.

A Teams group has been set up for these tutorials, and you should all have been added to that. Please feel free to ask me or each other any questions about the course content, and if you need any help with something I will do my best to reply there, or you can [email me](mailto:calum.henderson.19@ucl.ac.uk).

For submitting your weekly marked questions, as well as your assessments and final exam, you need to use the [Office Lens App](https://wiki.ucl.ac.uk/display/ELearningStudentSupport/Office+Lens). When laying out your submissions, please make it legible by making everything large enough and spacing out your answers. It really does help when your solutions are clearer.
